This repo currently uses vim instead of nvim file path to store configs for nvim.
That is because nvim was incorrectly interpreted as a submodule in github.
It will be switched back shortly.
To use this repo, first change vim to nvim using the command
'''
mv vim nvim
'''

when in the root of the repo
