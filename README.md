This repo contains the main dotfiles I use on Arch Linux with AwesomeWM.
The locations of all configuration folders can be set up automatically with the `applyConfig.sh` script, although make sure you read the logs carfuly before aproving each change so preexisting files do not get deleted.
Instead of cloning each folder into the correct location, the `applyConfig.sh` script creates symlinks so you can edit and store all your dotfiles from one folder.
You will still need to install the software that uses each config.
